Gameplay:

- a user selects the game difficulty (fetched from https://starnavi-frontend-test-task.herokuapp.com/game-settings), enters his/her name and press PLAY
- at the specified time interval a random square on the field highlights in blue
- if the user manages to click on the square during this time - it turns green and the player gets a point
- if not - the square turns red and a point goes to the computer
- when a player (or computer) paints >50% of all possible squares in his/her color - he/she becomes a winner
